A competition website for TMC (Tennessee Math Coalition)

Main goal is to host the online competition and allow individuals and teams to take their respective tests

Requirements:
1. Registration/Login capability
2. Timer
3. Competitions only available for a certain period of time
4. Answers saved to a database
5. Anti-cheating measures

Written in Typescript

Built using React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Material UI

Login/Registration uses Auth.js

Database is MongoDB

Problems:

Next.js is a full stack framework, and in the tutorial, they combined the backend and frontend into one project. Should we split the backend into a separate server and make API calls to it or is it fine to leave it as a fullstack application?
